  name: "Sit to stand"
  description: "Sit-to-stand (STS) is an important task for assessing dynamic
    balance and lower limb coordination and has a significant clinical
    relevance.
    STS is important also for assessing the performance of wearable lower-limb
    exoskeletons for assistance and humanoid robots that imitate human
    movements.
    These protocols and the associated PIs aim at the the assessment and
    benchmarking of the sit-to-stand gesture in intact and impaired individuals,
    in human/exoskeleton systems and in humanoid robots."

protocol:
  - name: "5 sit to stand"
    name_readable: "5STS measures how long it takes to complete 5 full STS
      cycles, starting from a sat position and reaching again the initial
      position.
      The output of this protocol and the associated PIs have a documented
      clinical relevance and are highly correlated with motor performance of
      different categories of subjects."
