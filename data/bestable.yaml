    step_description: "The protocol is composed of the gathering subject's
      native gait and perturbed gait after applying different perturbations -
      visual cues, that will appear on the surface of the treadmill.
      The subject should wear safety harness and would be instructed to walk in
      the center of the treadmill at the particular treadmill speed.
      During the unperturbed session (before enabling visual perturbations), the
      system is gathering/recording performance indicators (step length, step
      width, step time), which are calculated from the gait events (toe-off,
      heel-strike).
      Gait events are detected by using a COP-based algorithm that monitors COP
      pattern of the walking subject and outputs gait events of the left and
      right toe-offs and heel-strikes.
      After enabling visual perturbations, the visual target appear on the
      treadmill surface at (random) location, which deviates from the normal
      stepping position, while the subject needs to quickly react by stepping on
      a visual cue.
      This provokes a balance response of the next few steps.
      The system calculates target error, which is the minimum distance between
      COP and the center of the visual cue in a period, when visual cue is
      visible.
      After (random) number of recovery steps the new visual target appears for
      placing the left or right foot (depends on a protocol settings).
      The protocol finishes when all selected perturbations are triggered.
      The number of all perturbations (visual cues/targets) depends on selected
      perturbation direction (forward, inward, outward, forward-inward and
      forward-outward), number of repetitions and selection of the step targets
      (left foot, right foot or both feet).
      In case of all perturbation directions, one repetition per perturbation
      direction and both feet are selected, the number of all perturbations is
      10.
      The system outputs files about subject info, protocol condition,
      platformData (step-stamped data) and gaitEvents data (time-stamped data,
      includes COP and vertical GRF)."
