  description: "Stepping targets are visually projected onto the surface of a
    treadmill in unexpected timings and patterns.
    The prescribed stepping patterns emulate responses to mechanical balance
    perturbations, such as mediolateral and anteroposterior pushes to the pelvis
    by the BAR-TM robot of project partner URI."

    definition: "Walking on a treadmill and stepping on targets projected onto

      Outcome measures include the target hit rate, spatio-temporal stepping
      characteristics (e.g., stepping length, width, and time), and ground
      reaction forces."

      an instrumented treadmill at a prescribed speed.

      The characteristics of the stepping patterns will be recorded."

      - description: Place the 2 IMU sensors on the feet of the subject to
          measure gait events such as heel-strike and toe-off
        detail: A manual will be provided with detailed information.
      - description: Place the subject on the treadmill
      - description: Launch the software (Delsys Trigno utility and D-Flow) for
          recording the data and administering the protocol.
        detail: A manual will be provided with detailed information of the
          software.
      - description: Collect baseline data of walking to personalize the visual
          cues to the participant's normal gait patterns.
        detail: All instruments are recorded by the D-Flow software, and average
          step length and step width are computed.
          Foot placement is determined from centre of pressure measurements
          (force plate integrated in treadmill) and heel-strike events
          (wireless IMUs placed on feet).
      - description: Start the protocol.
          The treadmill will start running and the visual cues will be projected
          on the treadmill
      - description: Data collection will be automatically triggered during the
          tests
        detail: Data is recorded from all instruments with the D-Flow software.
      - description: Subject starts walking and different visual perturbation
          conditions will be applied, depending on the test condition.
          Conditions will be randomly ordered and repeated N times per limb.
        detail: "The timing, frequency, size, and direction of visual
          perturbations will be configurable by the experimenter, and
          perturbations will be administered in random order.
          Our submitted data will include the visual target shifted in 4
          different directions from nominal foot placement: forward, backward,
          left, and right."
      - description: The subject is expected to step on the visual
          perturbations, which are designed to destabalize the subject.
      - description: The raw signals are logged.
          The participant performance is evaluated by computation of outcome
          measures.
        detail: Performance can alternatively be computed off-site with the
          Eurobench software.
