    description: The profile used for the stimulus is a pseudorandom ternary
      signal, PRTS.
      A frequency response function shows how the stimulus affects the body
      sway.
      Different robots/conditions can be compared frequency-by frequency or
      considering the whole "energy" of the body sway.
      A small gain represents a better rejection of the disturbance but human
      like behavior is associated to a certain, non-zero, gain.
