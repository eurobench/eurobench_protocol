      - description: Place the optical markers and Delsys sensors onto the
          subject's body and take the required anthropometric measurements.
          Place the sensorized insoles in the subjects' shoes.
        detail: Following the VICON's "Full Body Plug in Gait" marker set
          specifications (https://docs.vicon.com/display/Nexus26/Full+body+modeling+with+Plug-in+Gait)
          and adding 8 clusters (thighs, tibias, feet, pelvis, chest).
      - description: Place the subject in the middle of the recording area.
      - description: Launch the Data collection software.
      - description: Take a static capture of the subject.
        detail: The subject must be standing in motorbike position (upright
          posture, both arms at shoulder's height with upper arm and forearm at
          90 degrees).
      - description: Place the subject at the starting point.
      - description: Ask the subject to walk through the testbed at a
          comfortable speed four times.
        detail: A capture per walk should be recorded.
      - description: Change the irregular terrain configuration of the testbed.
        detail: The order must be randomized.
      - description: Repeat the procedure starting at step 5 until completing
          all the terrain conditions.
      - description: Remove from the subject the optical markers from the
          pelvis, thighs, knees, tibias and ankles and put him/her the
          exoskeleton.
      - description: Let the subject walk with the exoskeleton over flat floor
          for 10 minutes so that he/she gets familiarized with it.
      - description: Repeat steps 5 to 8 until completing again four walks per
          terrain condition.
      - description: Remove the exoskeleton and optical markers from the subject.
