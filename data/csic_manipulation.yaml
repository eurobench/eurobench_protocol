    definition: "Lifting a box, which could be empty or loaded with the 10% of
      the subject’s weight, its placement on a horizontal support assembly at
      different heights, and the final lowering phase in order to bring the box
      back to its initial position.
      The subject must have performed 3 lifts with an empty box as well as 3
      lifts with a loaded one.
      This experiment is performed in the sagittal frame and between sagittal
      and frontal planes.
      The testbed is a non-reflectant modular structure consisting of a fixed
      frame and mobile bars, in order to be easily adjusted to the height of
      the knee and of the shoulder of each subject.
      On one hand, the fixed body is formed by 3 vertical bars, 2 of them are
      1.75 metres-long and the third one is 2 metres-long; connected to 4
      horizontal 1 metre-long bars at their ends.
      Moreover, 2 more 1 metre-long bars are used to close the square at
      floor-level in order to give more consistency to the structure.
      On the other hand, the mobile part is made up of four 1 metre-long bars
      fit in the fixed frame (2 bars per wall of the structure).
      These bars are mobile thanks to its design: a guiding system which allows
      moving the horizontal bar along the vertical ones with ease and 2 toggles
      on each bar to avoid time-consuming screwing tasks.
      On top of each mobile bar and at the middle region of it, there is a
      30x50 cm wooden shelf screwed to the bar, where the box should be placed
      during the lifting and the lowering phases."
