scenario:
  name: "How walking in the exoskeleton affects muscle coordination"
  description: "The rationale of this scenario is to characterize gait
    performance at the level of muscle coordination.
    It aims at characterizing how a user adapts to the exoskeleton walking and
    how the exoskeleton perturbs the operator’s control strategy and affects
    the spinal muscle coordination output.
    The proposed outcomes will provide important information about the neural
    control strategy and spinal locomotor output during walking with the
    exoskeleton, that will complement other performance indicators.
    While the scenario involves walking on a treadmill, it may also be extended
    to overgraound walking, walking on inclines, walking on uneven terrain,
    provided the reference data is updated for these scenarios by the user
    (PEPATO SW includes an option for the reference data update)."

    definition: "Several indicators of gait performance in the exoskeleton can
      be used based on kinematic/kinetic measurements, such as max speed,
      travelled distance, range of angular motion, joint torques, symmetry of
      lower limb movements, cognitive effort, etc.
      However, while such variables provide general characteristics of gait
      performance, only limited conclusions can be made about the neural control
      strategies based on these characteristics.
      Furthermore, some kinematic or kinetic parameters are a consequence of the
      control implemented on the exoskeleton.
      Therefore, standard indicators based on kinematics variables have
      limitations and need to be complemented by performance measures of muscle
      coordination and control strategy such as those generated by PEPATO.
      In particular, functional and structural changes at the spinal cord level
      induced by exoskeleton assisted walking can be mapped into muscle
      synergies and spinal maps of MN activity, as a means to look backward from
      the periphery to the central motor programming (Ivanenko et al. J
      Neurophysiol 2006, 95:602–618; Lacquaniti et al. J Physiol 2012,
      590:2189–2199; Martino et al. Clin Neurophysiol 2018, 129:516–525)."
