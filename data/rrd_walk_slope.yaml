  name: "Kinematics of slope walking of non-impaired individuals"
  description: "Slope walking influences the kinematics of the joints of the
    lower extremities when compared to level ground walking.
    Wearable robots should change their movement behavior once a subject is
    walking on an inclined surface.
    By benchmarking the joint kinematics of inclined walking of non-impaired
    individuals we can set a baseline to which inclined walking with bipedal
    robots can be compared."

      the bottom of the slope in such a way that the first step will be made on
      the slope.
      Start the measurement and ask the subject to walk up the slope and pause
      when both feet are on level ground.
      Stop the measurement once the subject reaches level ground with both feet.
      SLOPE DOWN: Ask the participant to stand at the top of the slope in such
      a way that the first step will be made on the slope.
      Start the measurement and ask the subject to walk down the slope and pause
      when the the subject is on level ground again.
      Stop the measurement once the subject reaches level ground with both feet."
