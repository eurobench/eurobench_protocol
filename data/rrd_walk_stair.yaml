scenario:
  name: "Kinematics of stair walking of non-impaired individuals"
  description: "Stair walking influences the kinematics of the joints of the
    lower extremities when compared to level ground walking.
    Wearable robots should change their movement behavior once a subject is
    walking on a stair.
    By benchmarking the joint kinematics of stair walking of non-impaired
    individuals we can set a baseline to which stair walking with bipedal robots
    can be compared."
