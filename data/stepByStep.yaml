    definition: "The protocol aims at assessing the subject''s motor control
      ability in stair ascending/descending through the analysis of the EMG

      The proposed metrics rely on the use of surface electromyography (sEMG),
      a technique to record the electrical activity produced by muscles during
      contraction; the stronger is the contraction, the higher is the electrical
      activity.
      The sEMG of Tibialis Anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), rectus femoris (RF),

      to fine-tuning the gait cycle kinematic parameters of the Ekso exoskeleton
      in a previous study (Molteni et al. 2017).
      The selection of these muscles is a good compromise between the setup time
      and the quantity of information extractable from the data but more muscles
      may be selected for other kinds of analyses (e.g. muscle synergies).
      Two kind of metrics will be presented: 1) an index quantifying the amount
      of activity of each muscles in each phase, e.g. TA_activity_stance_left,
      TA_activity_swing_left (same for SOL, RF, and HAM, and right leg) (Data
      are divided for a reference value, namely the activity of a MVC of 1
      second, to allow for comparison)
      2) an index quantifying cocontractions between agonist and antagonist
      muscles in swing and stance (TA-SOL_coco_stance_left,
      TA-SOL_coco_swing_left, RF-HAM_coco_stance _left, RF-HAM_coco_swing _left
      and same for right leg.
      In addition, through the analysis of the video the gait phases will be
      defined both in time unit and step percentage: stance_time _right,
      swing_time_right, stride_time_right, stance_time _left, swing_time_left,
      stride_time_left; stance_perc _right, swing_perc_right, stride_perc_right,
      stance_perc _left, swing_perc_left, stride_perc_left."

      The proposed metrics rely on the analysis of the ground reaction forces

      The aim is to assess the subjects capability of weight bearing by
      assessing both load and balance.
      Two kind of metrics are defined:
      1) PeakLoad_acceptance_left/right, PeakLoad_PushOff_left/right defined as
      the peak load in the specific phases (foot strike and push off).

      inter and intra subject comparison.
      2) CoP_sagittal_left/right, CoP_lateral_left/right defined as the maximum
      (negative or positive) CoP progression in the given direction.
