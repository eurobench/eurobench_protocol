  description: "TestEd is the testbed to simulate the industrial narrow space
    workstations.
    It can help to reconfigured its length and width hence there are many
    configuration that can be tested.
    Due to the workspace optimization techniques and lean manufacturing, the
    modern workstations are narrow.
    TestEd can help to simulate these workstations to test the wearable
    technology new concepts and prototypes.
    Its modular design and flexibility can help to quickly prepare the intended
    workstation.
    The inbuilt sensors and actuators ensure the data collection and safety of
    the subjects.
    For example, TestEd project demonstrate three configurations taken from
    automotive, construction and aeronautical industry.
    These configurations are by varying the length and width of the testbed i.e.
    config_Auto: L = 1533mm and W = 641mm; config_cont: L = 3000mm and
    W = 1400mm; conf_aero: L = 4500 and W = 1410"

    definition: "This protocol helps to benchmark the new wearable technologies
      for narrow workspaces.
      The user must know number of PI's, number of subjects, length and
      distance between the walls, number of runs and number of assiatnce levels
      of wearable robot before starting the test.
      Once the Testbed is configured to the desired scenario.
      The data is collected with and without the wearable robot/device.
      The protocol helps the user to test both relative data analysis and
      absolute data analysis.
      Below we describe the three configurations of the testbed:
      conf_auto: In sitting/standing posture, with both feet on the floor of the
      TestEd test bed with truck bending/straight.
      The subject performs a circular inspection of a profile placed on the
      force sensitive wall of the testbed.
      The subject will hold the quality control gauge in one hand to find the
      distance between the gap and flush of the profile."
