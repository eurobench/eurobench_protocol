  description: "The stability of bipedal locomotion is challenged when walking
    on an inclined surface.
    Changes of surface orientation asks for adequate adaption to the new
    situation, and therefore requires enhanced control of fore-aft and lateral
    stability.
    By assessing the control of gait stability and foot placement strategies,
    the gait stability of people using wearable robotic assistive devices or
    humanoid robots can be quantified."

  - name: "Walking on an inclined treadmill"
    name_readable: "Participants walk in an Computer Assisted Rehabilitation
      environment (CAREN, Motek, Forcelink, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), which
      comprises of an instrumented treadmill mounted on top of a 6 degrees of
      freedom moving platform.
      This set-up allows for changes in walking surface orientation by inclining
      the treadmill in either lateral or fore-aft direction.
      Furthermore, in this set-up the gait stability at different treadmill
      speeds can be assessed.
      Participants walk on varying treadmill orientations in both fore-aft and
      lateral directions, with varying treadmill speeds.
      Three dimensional full-body kinematics of participant and treadmill are
      recorded using a Vicon motion capture system."
