  name: "Picking and carrying objects"
  description: "The robot maintains balance when picking up and carrying an
  object at a certain distance.
  The test is finished if the robot has carried all objects or can’t overcome
  the weight of the current object.
  The test is repeated with and without markers on the objects to better assess
  the robot’s perception"
